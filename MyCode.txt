GIT is a version control system that allows software engineers to track changes in their code over time. It is useful for several reasons:

    Collaboration: GIT allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously, and it provides tools for resolving conflicts that may arise.

    Backup and recovery: GIT allows you to easily revert to a previous version of your code, which can be useful if you accidentally introduce a bug or want to experiment with different approaches.

    Branching: GIT makes it easy to create branches, which are separate copies of the codebase that can be developed independently. This is useful for implementing new features, fixing bugs, and experimenting with different approaches without affecting the main codebase.

    Auditing: GIT allows you to see a history of changes made to your codebase, so it's easy to track who made a specific change and when.

    Open-source: GIT is open-source, so it can be used and modified by anyone. This has led to a large and active community of users who have contributed to its development and created many useful tools and resources for working with GIT.
